##Customer Submission
**Idea:** Customers who wish to use our app will submit to us two separate versions of a design that they want feedback on. This can be screenshots of an app, color variations of a logo, different menu layouts for a website, etc. They will also specify at this time how many reviews they want on their mockups (10, 25, or 50).
